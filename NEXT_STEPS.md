## üìû Technical Considerations

### Dependencies to Add
```cmake
# For advanced processing
find_package(PCL REQUIRED)  # Point Cloud Library
find_package(OpenMP REQUIRED)  # Parallel processing
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)  # Already included via Ouster

# For GPU acceleration (Phase 3)
find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)
find_package(TensorRT REQUIRED)

# For networking (Phase 5)
find_package(ZeroMQ REQUIRED)
find_package(Protobuf REQUIRED)
```

### Architecture Decisions Needed
- **Processing pipeline design**: Synchronous vs asynchronous processing
- **Data flow architecture**: Push vs pull model for scan processing
- **Memory management**: RAII vs custom allocators for performance
- **Error handling**: Exception vs error code strategy
- **Configuration**: Compile-time vs runtime configuration

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: < 50ms end-to-end processing
- **Throughput**: > 10 Hz for full pipeline
- **Memory**: < 1GB for typical scenarios
- **CPU usage**: < 50% on target hardware
